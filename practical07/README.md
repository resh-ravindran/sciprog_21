# dma.c

- The implementation of dynamic memory allocation.
- The function `allocatearray` allocates memory to an array of size n.
- The function `fillwithones` fills the array with 1.
- The function `printarray` prints the array.
- The function `freeArray` frees the space allocated to the array.
- All the methods are called in order and the functions output is printed after execution.

# factorial.c
- Calculate the differrence between the estimate and the value from the polynomial equation.
- Consists of 2 functions, `calculateEquation and factorialFun` to calculate the polynomial.
- `factorialFun` function calculates the factorial of n.
- `calculateEquation` function calculate the equation of the factorial as `pow(x, i) / factorialFun(i)`.
- `exp(1)` from the math library is used to calculate the estimate.
