# matrixMul.c 

- Declare the 3 dimensions of an array as `n = 5, p = 3 and q = 4`.
- Define array a as sum of the values for 0 to n for 0 to p iterations
- Define array b as difference of the values for 0 to p for 0 to q iterations
- Define a resulting array c with 0 as values.
- Multiply the two arrays by iterating over the 0 to n for 0 to q and initialize c array values as 0.
- Calculate the c terms as multiplication a rows and b columns and add them to the c[i][j] and print the resulting array.
